## Overlapping generations (OLG) economy simulation
Below is R code defining two functions which produce simulations of a basic 2-period overlapping generations macro. model, featuring different tax regimes. Both OLG tax models support changes/"shocks" to parameters for comparative analysis. The first model incorporates a lump-sum tax during the period the agent works, which is repaid in the period when the agent doesn't work. The second model incorporates a tax on capital which is paid as retirement income during the non-working period.
